  <h2>Tagaytay</h2>
  <p>
    Out of all the tourist places in the Philippines, Tagaytay is quite popular in scenic beauty and the comfort its weather provides. Being perched at a higher altitude, you can view the famous Taal Lake and the Taal volcano. The Picnic Grove is another place where you can visit for a relaxing meal while marvelling at the far-off cliffs and a clear view of the ocean and some of the islands.

  <h2>Siargao</h2>
  <p>
    Siargao is known to be one of the famous places in the Philippines for surfing. Even though the island is very small, almost like a teardrop, it’s one of the most visited places. The entire island is bordered with white sandy beaches while the turquoise blue water washes off the shoreline. Inland waterfalls and lagoons are also present, which are major relaxing and rejuvenating spots.  </p>

  <h2>Secret Lagoon</h2>
  <p>
    The Secret Lagoon is a stunning hideaway lagoon that can only be accessed through a tiny intriguing cave. As you enter the cave on your boat, you will be astounded by the breathtaking towering limestone outcrops. The sharp outcrops are shrouded with lush trees that offer a contrasting appeal to the grey colour of the limestones.  </p>
